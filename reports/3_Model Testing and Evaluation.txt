The final segment involved a comprehensive evaluation of the tuned models and the stacking ensemble on the unseen test set. Each modelâ€™s performance was assessed using a suite of metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices, providing a clear picture of their generalization capabilities.

This evaluation highlighted the comparative strengths and weaknesses of both individual and ensemble approaches, informing the selection of the most effective model for deployment.

The results demonstrated that the chosen solution not only achieved high overall accuracy but also maintained strong recall for fraudulent claims, which is critical for real-world insurance fraud detection.

This rigorous testing phase validated the effectiveness of the entire workflow and ensured the reliability of the deployed model.
